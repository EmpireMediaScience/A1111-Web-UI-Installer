# A1111-Web-UI-Installer

_The readme, like the installer is a work in progress and very young_

This is a very early attempt at making a complete installer for **[Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)** for Windows 10 and 11 (haven't tested other versions but it might work)

If you want to just install it, [**check the latest realease (.exe)**](https://github.com/EmpireMediaScience/A1111-Web-UI-Installer/releases), if you want to improve the installer, git clone or fork & Pull Release !

## ⚠️ Be careful, this installer will always clone the latest update, and there's dozens of very experimental updates a day and no stable build yet, so let's pray you use this installer during a version window that's not broken

The current release works on my machine, I'm trying to find testers, bug reporters & feature requesters so if you find a glitch or have a feature request, please [**fill an issue**](https://github.com/EmpireMediaScience/A1111-Web-UI-Installer/issues) and more importantly **join [the new Automatic1111's SD WebUI discord](https://discord.gg/5KRHgNpz) to discuss the project and get general help about the WebUI**

If you want to contribute to the code, this project mainly uses [**Advanced Installer**](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/) and **Powershell**

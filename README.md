# A1111-Web-UI-Installer

This is a very early attempt at making a complete installer for **[Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)** for Windows 10 and 11 (haven't tested other versions but it might work)

The current release works on my machine, I'm trying to find testers, bug reporters & feature requesters so if you find a glitch or have a feature request, please [**fill an issue**](https://github.com/EmpireMediaScience/A1111-Web-UI-Installer/issues) and more importantly **join [the new Automatic1111's SD WebUI discord](https://discord.gg/5KRHgNpz) to discuss the project and get general help about the WebUI**

If you want to contribute to the code, this project mainly uses [**Advanced Installer**](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/) and **Powershell**
